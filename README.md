# Fake News Detection

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to develop a method to identify and classify fake news circulating on a social media platform. The increasing spread of misinformation poses a significant challenge, and our goal is to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate fake news.

## Objectives
- Explore and clean the dataset containing fake and factual news.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns.
- Build a classification model to distinguish between fake and factual news.
- Visualize results and communicate findings to stakeholders.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of news articles labeled as either "Fake" or "Factual." It contains features such as:
- **Title**: The headline of the news article.
- **Text**: The full content of the article.
- **Label**: Binary classification (Fake or Factual).
- **Source**: The news outlet that published the article (if available).
- **Date**: The publication date.

## Data Preprocessing
To ensure quality data for modeling, we perform the following steps:
1. **Remove missing values** to avoid inconsistencies.
2. **Tokenization** to break text into individual words.
3. **Stopword removal** to eliminate common words that do not add much meaning.
4. **Lemmatization** to convert words into their base forms.
5. **TF-IDF Vectorization** to transform textual data into numerical features for model training.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To understand trends and patterns in the dataset, we perform:
- Word cloud visualization to identify common words in fake and factual news.
- Distribution of word counts in both classes.
- Source credibility analysis.
- Sentiment analysis to check emotional tone variations.

## Model Selection & Training
We train different machine learning models and compare their performance:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Na√Øve Bayes**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
5. **Deep Learning (LSTM/Transformer-based model for advanced NLP)**

The models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- ROC-AUC Curve

## Results & Visualization
To effectively communicate our findings, we use:
- Confusion matrix to show classification performance.
- Bar plots comparing accuracy across models.
- Word frequency charts for fake vs factual news.
- Feature importance analysis to highlight key distinguishing words.

## Stakeholder Communication
We present our findings through:
- Interactive dashboards displaying key metrics.
- A report summarizing the impact of fake news and detection accuracy.
- Recommendations for improving fake news detection on the platform.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate external fact-checking sources for verification.
- Implement real-time detection using streaming data.
- Use advanced NLP techniques like transformers (BERT/GPT) for better accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project provides a framework for detecting fake news and reducing misinformation on social media. By using data-driven techniques, we can help ensure a more credible and trustworthy online information environment.
