# Fake News Detection

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to develop a method to identify and classify fake news circulating on a social media platform. The increasing spread of misinformation poses a significant challenge, and our goal is to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate fake news.

## Objectives
- Explore and clean the dataset containing fake and factual news.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns.
- Build a classification model to distinguish between fake and factual news.
- Visualize results and communicate findings to stakeholders.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of news articles labeled as either "Fake" or "Factual." It contains features such as:
- **Title**: The headline of the news article.
- **Text**: The full content of the article.
- **Label**: Binary classification (Fake or Factual).
- **Source**: The news outlet that published the article (if available).
- **Date**: The publication date.
